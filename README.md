## How Online Courses Work

Online courses run for 7 weeks. Each week we release pre-recorded lesson videos, quizzes and graded exercises on a key MongoDB subject. Expect approximately 2 hours of lessons per week delivered in a series of 3 to 5 minute videos. You may watch these videos at your own pace during the week, in the order you choose.

Homework is assigned in each week and should take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours to complete. At the end of 7 weeks, there is a final exam in the form of an extended problem set. Homework assignments account for one half of your grade and the final exam for the other half. Quizzes don't count toward your grade; they are intended to help you check your own understanding of the course material. 

Throughout the course, you may ask questions in the online discussion forums. Staff teaching assistants are always ready to help and other students regularly contribute answers.
